    "petAdvice": "While these bottles are perfect for keeping your Chihuahua hydrated during walks with their convenient fold-out bowls, we recommend using a proper pet bath or sink with appropriate dog shampoo for bathing. Regarding bathing frequency, most dogs don't require frequent baths as shampooing too often can strip their coat of natural oils, causing dryness. For small breeds like Chihuahuas, bathing every 4-6 weeks is typically sufficient unless they get particularly dirty or have skin conditions requiring more frequent cleaning.",
